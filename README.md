This was a 24-hour hackathon project for the Dev Bootcamp Career Week Hackathon in Oct 2016.

Team Members Forrest Wortham and Ben Newman built a real-time chat application using Rails 5 and ActionCable. 

We envisioned that veterans could connect with peers in one-on-one private chat sessions or in public chat rooms to offer mutual support and mental health resources.
We realized that a robust identity verification system would be critical to maintaining community health, but that it was slightly out of scope for this brief project. As an approximation we integrated Google's OAuth protocol to replicate the third-party verification process.
